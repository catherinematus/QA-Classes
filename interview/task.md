**Tasks**

1. Write a function called `isPalindrome` that identifies whether the specified `string` (parameter) is a palindrome - the word which reads the same backward as forward.

NOTE: it is prohibited to use `Array.prototype.reverse()` method in the function code.

```
"pop" => true
"clubs" => false
"pop " => false
"azza" => true
```

2. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` that receives an array of numbers as a parameter and returns a new array, where all numbers multiple of 3 are replaced with `fizz` string, all numbers multiple of 5 are replaced with `buzz`, and all numbers multiple of 3 and 5 are replaced with `fizzBuzz`.

```
[ 0, 5, 2, 6, 1, 30 ] => ["fizzBuzz", "buzz", 2, "fizzBuzz", 1, "fizzBuzz"]
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] => [1, 2, "fizz", 4, "buzz"]
```

3. Create a function called `findAllOccurrences` that returns a number of all occurrences of the specified item in a specified array.

```
[ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2 ], 1 => 3
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], 0 => 0
[ true, 0, 1, 'true' ], true => 1
```
